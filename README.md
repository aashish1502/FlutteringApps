# FlutteringApps

This is a repository of various flutter apps I have bulit (going to build) I will try my best to document the apps so that it is.

## Dice Roll
- Pretty self explainatory, just a button and a bunch of images that simulate a dice roll.
- Puts use of stateless and statefull widgets, how the element tree works and how an app is all put together.
- Also has a sick gradient.
